    <h3>URE Housing Ratings/Reviews</h3>
    <h4>URE Housing doesn’t have the best rating, especially considering how close the number of 5-star and 1-star reviews are</h4>

    <details>
        <summary>Main <strong>complaints</strong></summary>
        <ol>
            <li>Staff are "rude", "arrogant", or "unresponsive"</li>
            <li>Deposit and Billing issues: Multiple people mention being overcharged or cheated out of security deposits, as well as unexpected cleaning or damage fees.</li>
            <li>Communication Problems</li>
            <li>Reputation for Greed or exploitation</li>
            <li>Many of the issues current and former tenants have reported with URE Properties have been ongoing for nearly a decade</li>
        </ol>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Main <strong>positives</strong></summary>
        <ol>
            <li>Location and Convenience</li>
            <li>Praise for URE's maintenance team for being fast, responsive, and friendly</li>
            <li>A few other great experiences, meaning the company <em>can</em> deliver when things go right</li>
        </ol>
    </details>


    <details>
        <summary>Overall <strong>impressions</strong></summary>
        <ol>
            <li>URE has a polarizing reputation</li>
            <li>Satisfied tenants tend to mention quick maintenance and smooth move-ins, but are accused by others of being bots</li>
            <li>Angry Tenants emphasize money disputes, poor communication, and disrespectful treatment (specifically by certain staff)</li>
        </ol>
    </details>


    <details>
        <summary><em>So why do I recommend URE Housing anyway?</em></summary>
        <ol>
            <li>Mixed reviews are common for college housing</li>
            <li>Maintenance or billing frustrations are a very common pain for student properties everywhere</li>
            <li>A rating of 3.2 isn't a total deal breaker</li>
        </ol>
    </details>

    <p>The tone and repetition of certain complaints (especially about being overcharged, poor communication, and rude staff) suggest a pattern, not just isolated bad experiences</p>
    <p>The 3.2 average rating is unfortunately typical for college property management</p>

    <h4>But I recommend renting from them regardless because...</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>many students don’t realize how early they need to act to secure available units, and URE Properties allows you to sign leases as late as November</li>
        <li>The November timeline gives you extra time to either find non-URE properties as your main option or keep URE as a backup plan</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>With that being said, let's explore other, non-URE properties</h4>
