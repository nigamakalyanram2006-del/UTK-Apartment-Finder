    <h2>URE Housing</h2>

    <p> University Housing Offices often tweak the process slighly each year depending on calendears, schedules, and how long current tenants take to renew, but everything on this page is still accurate regardless</p>


    <details>
        <summary><strong>URE Timeline</strong></summary>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Anytime <em>before</em> November: </strong> Sign up to be added on the URE notification list <a href = "https://urehousing.com/" class = "link_interactive" target = "_blank"><strong>here</strong></a>, by sending a message saying you want to be on the notification list</li>
            <li>Shortly after, you will receive a <a href = "uretxtmessage.jpeg" class = "link_interactive" target = "_blank"><strong>text message</strong></a> letting you know you're on the notification list</li>
            <li><strong>Early-Mid November: </strong> URE will send out an email that outlines the application process</li>
            <li><strong>Later in November: </strong> URE will notify with a list of units that will be available for rent. It is at this time that the application process opens up, and URE accepts applications/fees</li>
        </ol>
    </details>


    <details>
        <summary><strong>URE Process</strong></summary>
        <ol>
            <li>Once Application opens up, you <strong>must</strong> click <a href = "ureapplynow.png" class = "link_interactive" target = "_blank"><em><strong>Apply Now</strong></em></a> under desired property. <strong>Do not</strong> download the <a href = "urerentalapp.png" class = "link_interactive" target = "_blank"><em><strong>Rental Application</strong></em></a> under Forums, as that is for physical applications to submit to URE's leasing office only</li>
            <li>When applying for property, apply for your 1st choice property <strong>only</strong>. If it is unavailable, URE can transfer your application to another property as this saves you from paying multiple <strong>$75 application fees</strong></li>
        </ol>
    </details>

    <p><strong>Please note that each roommate must submit their own separate applications. List your roommates in your application so that URE knows you're applying as a group</strong></p>

    <ol start = "3">

        <li>After you have submitted your application, URE will email you a separate <strong>Parent Co-Sign Form</strong> that your parents must fill out, sign, and submit back to URE</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Here is a <a href = "https://urehousing.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/URE-Parent-Form.pdf" class = "link_interactive" target = "_blank">preview</a> of what the Parent Co-Sign Form could look like, but <em>do not</em> use it</strong></p>


    <details>
        <summary><em>What is a Parent Co-Sign Form?</em></summary>
        <p>A form your parents must fill out <strong>if</strong> they are a party with an established financial history who agrees to back you up on the lease. They will be paying your rent and other fees basically</p>
    </details>
    <ol start = "4">
        <li>At this time, you should <strong>book a tour</strong> immediately and visit your apartment as soon as possible, to make sure you actually like it</li>
        <li>Once your application and parent co-sign form is approved, you will be offered <strong>a lease to sign</strong></li>
        <li>After signing the lease, you’ll submit the <strong>security deposit</strong> and any other <strong>move-in fees</strong> as specified in the lease</li>
    </ol>
    <div class = "smallerbgc_everything">
        <h3>Summary: Process Flow</h3>
        <h4>Application → Parent Co-sign → Approval → Lease Signing → Deposit & Move-in Payments</h4>
        <strong>Note that the <em>faster/sooner</em> you finish this process, the <em>higher/better</em> chances are of getting your preferred unit</strong>
