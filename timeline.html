    <h3>Timeline for Renting Apartments</h3>

    <h4>This is a rough timeline for you to follow, but note that it differs from property to property</h4>

    <div class = "smallerbgc_everything">
        <p>Once you've finalized a couple properties (I say “a couple” because it’s best to have backups in case your first choice isn’t available, doesn't meet your needs, the lease terms change, or something unexpected comes up/goes wrong) try to submit your applications and sign a lease as soon as possible, around October or November (December at the latest)</p>
        <p>As I’ve said before, this is only a rough estimate of a timeline, as each property differs. Some apartments are high in demand and fill up very quickly, while others only open applications in October or November.

            So, it’s important to stay flexible: start your search early, have backup options, and be ready to act quickly when a unit you like becomes available</p>

        <h4>With that in mind, it's worth turning your attention to <strong>URE Housing</strong>. Because URE University Real Estate Property Management follow a fairly accurate and consistent timeline each year. Their system isn't public information, so I will help explain it, as their properties check all the boxes for student-friendly living, and give you more time to prepare yourself for the process. </h4>
